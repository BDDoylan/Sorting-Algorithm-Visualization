                        visualizations of different sorting algorithms in javascript. Being 
                        new to web development this is our first test in making a fully

                        learning new technologies and applying them.

                        this coming year I am ever growing and learning to program at a high level where my skills and
                        creativity could find use and be applied to work and inventive ideas across all areas.
                        Developing the skills I call my own and learning new ones I want to put them to good use by 
                        creating projects and practicing good workflow habits so I can fit in any team and enviroment

                        Hello there, to whomever is reading this, I am a sophomore and 2nd year student. 
                        My level of coding is intermediate  with my specialization in C++ and python. 
                        I enjoy doing projects like this one where I end up learning a lot and anything to better myself in coding and as a team player is ideal. 
                        I am very proud with how this project turned out with a ground-up development and a lot was learned.
